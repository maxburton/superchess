##Prologue: 

##Chapter 1: Total War
See the harrowing nature of war through the eyes of e4e6th French Defence Battalion fighting the fascist German Opening.
Squad leader Sgt. Rooke leads Pvt. Pawnsley and his men through a minefield of traps and gambits.

Special mechanics:
* Wounded Pieces: When a piece is taken, it remains on the board as "wounded", and cannot move. These wounded pieces 
can be killed by "retaking" it after the original taker has left the space.
Wounded pieces can be revived by "Medic" pieces
* Medics: Pacifistic pieces whose sole purpose is to save lives. Although they cannot attack, they move fast than the
average grunt, able to move 2 cardinal spaces per turn. They are also able to move 3 spaces directly forward on their
first turn, to get into the battlefield quicker. When "taking" a wounded piece, medics are only able to retreat 1
space backwards or diagonally backwards towards home base, due to the extra weight. Medics can also treat enemy wounded,
who become "POWs" when returned to base. Knowingly attacking a medic is a breach of Swiss conventions.
* POWs: Can be used for enemy intelligence or to bolster your ranks.
* Swiss Convention: Certain actions are considered war crimes. Assuming you win the war, these actions are erased
from history, but if you lose, you will be held accountable. Criminal actions include: wounding or killing medics,
poor treatment of POWs. Your ranking will drop more harshly depending on the severity of your crimes.

##Chapter 2: Flat Boarders
Modern bishopry has proposed the existence of a 3rd dimension, though the majority of pieces remain sceptic.
